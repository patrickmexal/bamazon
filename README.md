Greetings! I still haven't gotten this app working one hundred percent as of 4:51PM on January Thirty First. I have a good SQL connection, and I feel like my logic is ok. I've tried so many derivations on what I have and I'm still throwing an error. I have screen grabs in the folder BamazonSG. It isn't the trainwreck that last weeks homework was, so I feel ok about it.
